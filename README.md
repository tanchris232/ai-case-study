## Landscape 

- **What field is the company in?**: Viz Ai operates in the healthcare field.
- **What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5 & 10 years?**: In the last 5 to 10 years the healthcare space has been trending to be more reliant on technology in the hospitals. One of these trends includes the use of AI to create a more efficient system, which we see with Viz AI. More trends include the use of generative AI to create chatbots and virtual assistants that will help personalize the experience for the patients. IoT powered virtual hospitals where telemedicine and wearable devices connect to the global network known as the Internet of Things which will allow doctors to remotely monitor patients and give suggestions for care without having to schedule in person appoiintments. Lastly Virtual and Augmented Reality where surgeons are actually now able to practice the surgery in a virtual reality that can closely mimic the operations that they are about to perform as a form of practice. [^5]
- **What are the other major companies in this field?**: Other major companies that operate in the same space as Viz AI include: Brainomix who focuses on AI-powered imaging biomarkers, RapidAI who developed an advanced stroke imaging platform and uses AI to combat life threatening illnesses, and 16-bit who develops software-based medical devices and screens for bone age estimation.

## Results

- **What has been the business impact of this company so far?**: The business impact of Viz AI so far has been their ability to completely alter the way that hospitals and doctors go about diagnosing and treating patients. With the use of Viz AI doctors now have the ability to accelerate care for stroke patients in a scenario where every minute matters. In one of the demo videos for Viz AI a doctor explains that on average it takes 15 minutes to diagnose and triage a stroke patient. Every minute on average a stroke patient can lose millions of neurons and now with Viz AI they are able to get care to these patient in less time potentially saving them extremely valuable brain function.
- **What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?**: The best measure for success for Viz AI's technology would be improving lives of stroke patients and saving lives utilizing their streamlined workflows that Viz AI makes possible and also being implemented in as many hospitals as possible. The company has been performing very well based on the metrics provided by saving extremely valuable minutes for every stroke patient where the hospital utilizes Viz AI. As far as implementation in hospitals they have been very successful so far. While Viz AI has only been around for 7 years they have already been implented in over 1,000 of the 6,090 hospitals nationwide.
- **How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?**: When compared to their competitors Viz AI is outperforming all of them. Compared to Brainomix they have raised over $250 million more in total funding in 6 fewer years. Compared to RapidAI they have raised over $189 million in 4 fewer years. the last notable competitor is still considered to be in the incubation stage so Viz AI is far ahead of them at this time. While there might be other metrics that could define performance I believe that in this case fundraising is a top indicator given that this would point to investors believing that Viz AI is the superior product in this space.

## Recommendations

- **If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?**: If I were with Viz AI, given their success, my only recommendation would be just to begin implementing their technologies into different specialties across care. Right now Viz AI mainly focuses on brain and heart issues but, I think that if they were able to expand into different care specialties that deal with different imaging and areas of the body that they could become a standard in healthcare across the world.
- **Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?**: I think that offering their services for all specialties would allow them to be almost a necessity in hospitals across the world and obviously more business will positively impact the company.
- **What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?**: The technologies that this recommendation would utilize would be the same technologies that they are currently using but an expansion that includes different scans or tests run by different specialties within the hospitals.
- **Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?**: These technologies are appropriate for the solution because they would be required for Viz AI to branch into all healthcare specialties.
